# BlackBox Enhanced

> Android virtual environment with IL2CPP dumper and app isolation.

## What This Is

BlackBox Enhanced creates a virtual Android environment where you can run apps in isolation. It includes a dumper that attempts to extract IL2CPP metadata (class names, method names, field names, offsets) from apps that use Unity's IL2CPP backend.

**Important caveats:**
- The IL2CPP dumper works best with apps that have `global-metadata.dat` in their data directory
- Field offsets are approximate (simplified alignment) - not exact struct layouts
- Method RVAs are extracted from metadata tables, not from disassembled code
- The dumper cannot bypass server-side validation or online anti-cheat that phones home to external servers
- This tool is for **educational and research purposes**

## Features

### Virtual Environment
- Run apps in isolated containers (like a sandbox)
- Multi-account support (run same app multiple times)
- Shell script (.sh) execution support

### IL2CPP Dumper (v0.2.0)
- **Real metadata parsing** from `global-metadata.dat` (IL2CPP v24-v29)
- Extracts actual class names, namespaces, field names, method names
- Generates `dump.cs` with real IL2CPP class/method structure
- Computes approximate field offsets within class structs
- Extracts method RVAs and tokens from metadata tables
- Generates `il2cpp.h` / `main.h` / `game.h` / `il2cpp_offsets.h`
- ELF binary analysis of `libil2cpp.so`
- Hex dump and string extraction from native libraries
- Fallback to raw string extraction when metadata parse fails
- DEX file parsing for additional class/method information

### Anti-Detection Bypasses
- Root hiding (Magisk, KSU, APatch)
- Frida/Xposed/Substrate hook detection bypass
- SafetyNet/Play Integrity bypass (MeowBox / YuriKey modes)
- VPN hiding
- Emulator detection bypass
- Online bypass (blocks known anti-cheat/analytics hosts)
- Enhanced fake location with GPS simulation

### Other
- Immersive fullscreen mode (game-like)
- Persistent signing key (install-over without data loss)
- Debug logging throughout
- Android 5.0 - 17 support
- Real root manager with per-app control
- Zygisk module support
- LSPosed/Xposed framework support
- Online bypass (200+ hosts across 7 categories)
- Comprehensive dump with logging
- Status displays in Settings

## Dump Output

All dumps go to: `/storage/emulated/0/Download/black/dump/(packagename)/`

## Building

The project builds via GitHub Actions. APKs are uploaded to the [Releases](https://github.com/Opanxxc/BlackBox-Enhanced/releases) page.

To build locally:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Requirements

- Android 5.0+ (API 21+)
- The target app must use IL2CPP backend (not Mono) for full dump support

## Known Limitations

- Field offsets are approximate - use Il2CppDumper on a PC for exact offsets
- Cannot dump apps with heavily obfuscated metadata
- Server-side anti-cheat cannot be bypassed from the client
- Some integrity checks (SafetyNet device attestation) may still fail on rooted devices
